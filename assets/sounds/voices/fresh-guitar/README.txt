## Using the instrument

Keys 36-84 (coloured purple on the interface) represent the guitar notes from bottom E to the topmost C on the guitar (top E string fret 20).
Keys 31-35 (grey on the interface) fire samples of fingering-derived guitar sounds such as squeaks, top taps, thumb slaps and damping.
Note that key 35 (percussive mute) not only fires the sound of the strings being muted, but also mutes any notes currently playing, as it would on a real guitar.
Notes 101-124 generate chords (101-112 downstrum, 113-124 upstrum). The type of chord (major, minor, 7th etc) is determined by keyswitches on keys 89-100

## The Story

I'm thoroughly enjoying both Decent Sampler and the Pianobook community (many thanks to all those involved) and decided it was time I offered something back. This library is the second version of a sample pack of my Freshman acoustic, recorded both with a Sennheiser dynamic mic near the soundhole, and via the guitar's inbuilt piezo pickup, into Reaper on Linux. There are also a few fingering-related noise samples to hopefully add a little more realism if required. The samples contain a few odd resonances and similar artifacts, but these were present in the real instrument so I didn't attempt to remove or work around them, but left them as-is.
The guitar was sampled with three round robins and a single velocity layer.
The dynamic mic, piezo and fingering noises each have their own level controls, plus controls for plectrum sound, palm muting, bass cut and overall tone and reverb effects.
