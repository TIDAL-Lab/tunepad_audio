## Using the instrument

The instrument is rather simple to use. You can choose a style and combine it with a convolution effect if you want to. You also have the option to change the tone of the instrument (using the tone knob as a lo-pass filter), control the amount of reverb and room size, as well as the amount of delay and the delay time.

In total, there are the following seven styles to choose from:
- Clean Harsh
- Clean Soft
- Clean Wide
- Staccato
- Reversed
- Vintage
- Amped

You can combine these styles with a convolution effect if you like. You have the following options to choose from:
- Big Room
- Small Room
- Glide
- Slide
- Wind
- Wobbly
- Fan (long)
- Fan (short)
- Drums (80 BPM)

## The Story

I received this music box as a gift one year ago and while it looks cool on the shelf, I wondered, 'Why shouldn't I use this for making music?' So I recorded some samples of it and added various effects to create different soundscapes. In my opinion, these sounds are awesome for ear candy, but you can also use them to create ambient sounds (try the wind and fan convolution effects for that) or even play a whole lead melody.
