## Included formats

- Decent Sampler

## Using the instrument

I sampled two djembes--one a wooden body with animal hide drum head, the other I believe a fibreglass body with a synthetic drum head--with 6 different drum hits each (the names I'm using here may not be the most commonly used terms): Bass note (hitting the centre of the drum), Tone (striking the edge of the drum with the full hand), Slap (striking the edge of the drum with just the finger tip), Muffled (the same strike as the Tone but leaving the hand on the drum head instead of recoiling immediately), Muted Tone (the same strike with the other hand pressing gently on the centre of the drum), and Muted Slap (the same idea as Muted Tone but with the Slap technique). This is the order, from Left to Right on the keyboard, that the sounds play in the instrument, going from C2 to G3. The keys of the Decent Sampler player's keyboard are colour-coded to each drum: The Brown keys play the Wooden Body djembe (because it's brown), and the Red keys play the Fibreglass Body djembe (because it's red). Or, if you are unable to see the different coloured keys, the Wooden Body djembe's notes are C2 for the Bass, E2 for the Tone, G2 for the Slap, B2 for the Muffled, D3 for the Muted Tone, F3 for the Muted Slap, and the Fibreglass Body djembe's notes are D2 for the Bass, F2 for the Tone, A2 for the Slap, C3 for the Muffled, E3 for the Muted Tone, G3 for the Muted Slap.
The Reverb knob controls the wet/dry mix of a convolution reverb, and can be controlled by the Mod Wheel.
There are 2 velocity layers and 4 Round Robin samples in each velocity layer for each drum hit.

## The Story

Having recently taken the plunge to learn the inns and outs of creating a sample library/instrument/whatever-you-want-to-call-it for the Decent Sampler, I looked around wondering what I could sample to create a new instrument. The first thing my gaze landed upon were my two djembes, so I got ready to have some fun hitting my drums. I know next to nothing about the creation of these drums - one was a gift from my parents, and is I believe a fibreglass body with a synthetic drum head and a metal ring holding the drum head in place vs the traditional roping. The other is one I stumbled upon in a traveling shop set up in the middle of the mall selling many interesting and random things, advertised to be all hand-made in Indonesia. This second drum has a more traditional wooden body, I'm fairly confident the drum head is animal hide (whether it is the traditional goat skin I couldn't say though), and the traditional roping holding the drum head in place. Both drums are fairly similar in size but have different sound from their different shapes and materials.

I recorded 6 different types of drum hits with 2 velocity layers and 4 round robins in each velocity layer for each drum hit. I'm always a fan of using a dynamic mic to close mic drums, so I used my SM58 through an ART Tube MP preamp for a little bit of that nice tubey warmth and goodness.

I felt that the thing to do was to keep this instrument pretty simple, so the only extra thing I included is a knob to control the wet/dry mix of a convolution reverb, which can be controlled via the mod wheel.

Hopefully this is something that other people can enjoy and get some use out of. If so, happy composing!
